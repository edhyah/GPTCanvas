# GPT Canvas

Conversations are not linear and should be visualized as trees!

## What is this?

This is a new chatbot UI for ChatGPT that visualizes conversations as trees on
a 2D canvas rather than a linear experience. This would allow users to follow
different conversation branches, ask multiple questions related to various
parts of a given response, and return to previous nodes to explore new
branches.
